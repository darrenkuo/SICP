We're all done teaching you the syntax of Scheme; from now on it's
all big ideas!
<br/><br/>
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
This week's big idea is <i>function as object </i> (that is, being able
to manipulate functions as data) as opposed to the more familiar view
of function as process, in which there is a sharp distinction between
program and data.
<br/><br/>
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
The usual metaphor for function as process is a recipe.  In that metaphor,
the recipe tells you what to do, but you can't eat the recipe; the food
ingredients are the "real things" on which the recipe operates.  But
this week we take the position that a function is just as much a "real
thing" as a number or text string is.
<br/><br/>
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
Compare the <i>derivative </i> in calculus:  It's a function whose domain
and range are functions, not numbers.  The derivative function treats
ordinary functions as things, not as processes.  If an ordinary function
is a meat grinder (put numbers in the top and turn the handle) then the
derivative is a "metal grinder" (put meat-grinders in the top...).
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<font face="symbol"></font> Using functions as arguments.
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
Arguments are used to generalize a pattern.  For example, here is a pattern:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.3/general.scm
(define pi 3.141592654)
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
(define (square-area r) (* r r))
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
(define (circle-area r) (* pi r r))
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
(define (sphere-area r) (* 4 pi r r))
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
(define (hexagon-area r) (* (sqrt 3) 1.5 r r))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
In each of these procedures, we are taking the area of some geometric
figure by multiplying some constant times the square of a linear dimension
(radius or side).  Each is a function of one argument, the linear
dimension.  We can generalize these four functions into a single function
by adding an argument for the shape:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.3/general.scm
(define (area shape r) (* shape r r))
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
(define square 1)
(define circle pi)
(define sphere (* 4 pi))
(define hexagon (* (sqrt 3) 1.5))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
We define names for shapes; each name represents a constant number that
is multiplied by the square of the radius.
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
In the example about areas, we are generalizing a pattern by using a
variable <i>number </i> instead of a constant number.  But we can also
generalize a pattern in which it's a <i>function </i> that we want to
be able to vary:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.3/general.scm
(define (sumsquare a b)
  (if (&#62; a b)
      0
      (+ (* a a) (sumsquare (+ a 1) b)) ))
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
(define (sumcube a b)
  (if (&#62; a b)
      0
      (+ (* a a a) (sumcube (+ a 1) b)) ))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
Each of these functions computes the sum of a series.  For example,
<tt>(sumsquare 5 8)</tt> computes 5<sup>2</sup>+6<sup>2</sup>+7<sup>2</sup>+8<sup>2</sup>.  The process of
computing each individual term, and of adding the terms together,
and of knowing where to stop, are the same whether we are adding
squares of numbers or cubes of numbers.  The only difference is in
deciding which function of <tt>a</tt> to compute for each term.  We
can generalize this pattern by making <i>the function </i> be an
additional argument, just as the shape number was an additional argument to
the area function:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>(define (sum fn a b)
  (if (&#62; a b)
      0
      (+ (fn a) (sum fn (+ a 1) b)) ))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
Here is one more example of generalizing a pattern involving functions:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.3/keep.scm
(define (evens nums)
  (cond ((empty? nums) '())
        ((= (remainder (first nums) 2) 0)
         (se (first nums) (evens (bf nums))) )
        (else (evens (bf nums))) ))
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
(define (ewords sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((member? 'e (first sent))
         (se (first sent) (ewords (bf sent))) )
        (else (ewords (bf sent))) ))
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
(define (pronouns sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((member? (first sent) '(I me you he she it him her we us they them))
         (se (first sent) (pronouns (bf sent))) )
        (else (pronouns (bf sent))) ))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
Each of these functions takes a sentence as its argument and returns a
smaller sentence <i>keep </i>ing only some of the words
in the original, according to a certain criterion: even numbers, words that
contain the letter <tt>e</tt>, or pronouns.  We can generalize by writing a
<tt>keep</tt> function that takes a predicate function as an additional
argument.
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>(define (keep pred sent)
  (cond ((empty? sent) '())
        ((pred (first sent)) (se (first sent) (keep pred (bf sent))) )
        (else (keep pred (bf sent))) ))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div>

<font face="symbol"></font> Unnamed functions.

</td></tr></table> 
 
 
We can use the generalized <tt>sum</tt> function this way:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (define (sinsq x) (* (sin x) (sin x)))
&#62; (sum sinsq 5 8)
2.408069916229755
 
</pre></tt> 
 <div class="p"><!----></div> 
But it seems a shame to have to define a named function <tt>sinsq</tt> that
(let's say) we're only going to use this once.  We'd like to be able to
represent the function <i>itself </i> as the argument to <tt>sum</tt>, rather
than the function's name.  We can do this using <tt>lambda</tt>:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>&#62; (sum (lambda (x) (* (sin x) (sin x))) 5 8)
2.408069916229755
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>Lambda</tt> is a special form; the formal parameter list obviously isn't
evaluated, but the body isn't evaluated <i>when we see the </i> <tt>lambda</tt>,
either-only when we invoke the function can we evaluate its body.

> First-class data types.
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
A data type is considered <i>first-class </i> in a language if it can be
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
 
<dl compact="compact"> 
 <dt> 
<font face="symbol"></font

the value of a variable (i.e., named)

<font face="symbol"></font

<dd>the return value from a function
</dd> 
 <dt> 
<font face="symbol"></font
></dt> 
<dd>a member of an aggregate
</dd></dl>In most languages, numbers are first-class; perhaps text strings (or
individual text characters) are first-class; but usually functions are not
first-class.  In Scheme they are.  So far we've seen the first two
properties; we're about to look at the third.  (We haven't really talked
about aggregates yet, except for the special case of sentences, but we'll see
in chapter 2 that functions can be elements of aggregates.)  It's one of the
design principles of Scheme that everything in the language should be
first-class.  Later, when we write a Scheme interpreter in Scheme, we'll
see how convenient it is to be able to treat Scheme programs as data.

The derivative is a function whose domain and range are functions.
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
People who've programmed in Pascal might note that Pascal allows functions
as arguments, but <i>not </i> functions as return values.  That's because
it makes the language harder to implement; you'll learn more about this
in CS&nbsp;164.

(We assume, to simplify this presentation, that the equation has two
real roots; a more serious program would check this.)
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.3/roots.scm
(define (roots a b c)
  (se (/ (+ (- b) (sqrt (- (* b b) (* 4 a c)))) (* 2 a))
      (/ (- (- b) (sqrt (- (* b b) (* 4 a c)))) (* 2 a)) ))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
This works fine, but it's inefficient that we have to compute the square
root twice.  We'd like to avoid that by computing it once, giving it a
name, and using that name twice in figuring out the two solutions.  We
know how to give something a name by using it as an argument to a function:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.3/roots.scm
(define (roots a b c)
  (define (roots1 d)
    (se (/ (+ (- b) d) (* 2 a))
        (/ (- (- b) d) (* 2 a)) ))
  (roots1 (sqrt (- (* b b) (* 4 a c)))) )
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>Roots1</tt> is an internal helper function that takes the value of the
square root in the formula as its argument <tt>d</tt>.  <tt>Roots</tt> calls <tt> 
roots1</tt>, which constructs the sentence of two numbers.
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
This does the job, but it's awkward having to make up a name <tt>roots1</tt> 
for this function that we'll only use once.  As in the <tt>sum</tt> example
earlier, we can use <tt>lambda</tt> to make an unnamed function:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.3/roots.scm
(define (roots a b c)
  ((lambda (d)
     (se (/ (+ (- b) d) (* 2 a))
         (/ (- (- b) d) (* 2 a)) ))
   (sqrt (- (* b b) (* 4 a c))) ))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
This does exactly what we want.  The trouble is, although it works fine
for the computer, it's a little hard for human beings to read.  The
connection between the name <tt>d</tt> and the <tt>sqrt</tt> expression that
provides its value isn't obvious from their positions here, and the
order in which things are computed isn't the top-to-bottom order of the
expression.  Since this is something we often want to do, Scheme provides a
more convenient notation for it:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.3/roots.scm
(define (roots a b c)
  (let ((d (sqrt (- (* b b) (* 4 a c)))))
    (se (/ (+ (- b) d) (* 2 a))
        (/ (- (- b) d) (* 2 a)) )))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
Now we have the name next to the value, and we have the value of <tt>d</tt> 
being computed above the place where it's used.  But you should remember
that <tt>let</tt> does not provide any new capabilities; it's merely an
abbreviation for a <tt>lambda</tt> and an invocation of the unnamed function.
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
 <div class="p"><!----></div> 
The unnamed function implied by the <tt>let</tt> can have more than one
argument:
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
<tt>  <pre>;;;;;                        In file cs61a/lectures/1.3/roots.scm
(define (roots a b c)
  (let ((d (sqrt (- (* b b) (* 4 a c))))
        (-b (- b))
        (2a (* 2 a)))
    (se (/ (+ -b d) 2a)
        (/ (- -b d) 2a) )))
 
</pre></tt> 
 
<div class="p"><!----></div> 
Two cautions:  (1) These are not long-term "assignment statements" such
as you may remember from other languages.  The association between names
and values only holds while we compute the body of the <tt>let</tt>.  (2) If
you have more than one name-value pair, as in this last example, they are
not computed in sequence!  Later ones can't depend on earlier ones.  They
are all arguments to the same function; if you translate back to the
underlying <tt>lambda</tt>-and-application form you'll understand this.
 
<div class="p"><!----></div>
