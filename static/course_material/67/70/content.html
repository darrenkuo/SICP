1.  <i>SICP </i> ex.&nbsp;2.25 and 2.53; these should be quick and easy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2.  <i>SICP </i> ex.&nbsp;2.55; <b>explain your answer to your TA.</b>

3.  <i>SICP </i> ex.&nbsp;2.27.  This is the central exciting adventure
of today's lab!  Think hard about it.

4.  Each person individually make up a procedure named <tt>mystery</tt>
that, given two lists as arguments, returns the result of applying
<i>exactly two </i> of <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>append</tt>, or <tt>list</tt> to
<tt>mystery</tt>'s arguments, using no quoted values or other
procedure calls.  Here are some examples of what is and is not
fair game:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>  <pre>okay                               not okay

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (mystery L1 L2)            (define (mystery L1 L2)
  (cons L1 (append L2 L1)))          (cons L1 (cons L2 (cons L1 L2))))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (mystery L1 L2)            (define (mystery L1 L2)
  (list L1 (list L1 L1)))            (cons L1 L2))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(define (mystery L1 L2)            (define (mystery L1 L2)
  (append (cons L2 L2) L1))          (append L1 (cons L1 '(A B C))))

</pre></tt>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Type your <tt>mystery</tt> definition into a file, and have one of
your partners load it into Scheme and try to guess what it is by
trying it out with various arguments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After everyone has tried someone else's procedure, decide with your
partners which procedure was hardest to guess and why, and what
test cases were most and least helpful in revealing the definitions.
